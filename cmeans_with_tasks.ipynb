    "# $C$-means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Problem: Identification of Groups or clusters of data points in a multidimensional space.\n",
    "* Given a dataset $\\{\\mathbf{x}_1,\\ldots\\mathbf{x}_N\\}$ containing $N$ observations of a $D$-dimensional Euclidean random variable $\\mathbf{x}$.\n",
    "* The goal is to separate the data points into $C$ clusters, considering first that $C$ is given.\n",
    "* A cluster can be considered as a group of data points, in which the distance between points of the same cluster is small compared to the distance of a point of the cluster and one outside the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "* We introduce a set of $D$-dimensional vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ with $c=1,\\ldots,C$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ is the *prototype* which is associated with the cluster $c$.\n",
    "* Intuitively we can imagine that $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ is the center (the focal point) of a cluster.\n",
    "* The goal is to assign data points to clusters and find a set of vectors $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c\\}$ so that the sum of the squared distances of each data point to the closest vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Point Assignment\n",
    "* To describe the assignment of data points to clusters, a set of binary indicator variables $r_{nk} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ with $c=1,\\ldots,C$ will be introduced for each data point $\\mathbf{x}_n$, and which describes to which cluster $C$ the point belongs.\n",
    "* If $\\mathbf{x}_n$ belongs to cluster $c$, then $r_{nc}=1$ and $r_{nj}=0$ are for all $j \\neq c$ (1-out of-$C$-Coding scheme).\n",
    "* The target function (*distortion measure*)\n",
    "\t$$J = \\sum_{n=1}^N \\sum_{c=1}^C r_{nc}\\lVert\\mathbf{x}_n-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c\\rVert^2 \n",
    "\t= \\sum_{n=1}^N \\sum_{c=1}^C r_{nc} (\\mathbf{x}_n-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c)^{\\mathrm{T}}(\\mathbf{x}_n-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c)$$\t\n",
    "\tthen describes the sum of squared distance between each data point to *its* vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to find the value of $\\{r_{nc}\\}$ and $\\{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c\\}$, or to minimize $J$.\n",
    "* This is possible in an iterative process consisting of two alternating steps, each of which operates optimizations regarding $r_{nc}$ or $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$:\n",
    "    The initial values of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ are first chosen.\n",
    "    - E (expectation): In the first step $J$ is minimized relative to $r_{nc}$, where the value of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ is fixed.  \n",
    "    - M (maximization): In the second step $J$ is minimized relative to $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ where $r_{nc}$ is fixed.\n",
    "    The two steps are repeated until the process converges.\n",
    "* Terms E and M will later become clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "E-step: determine the value of $r_{nc}$\n",
    "* $J$ is a linear function of $r_{nc}$ and the optimization can be easily done.\n",
    "* The terms for different $n$ are independent and for each $n$, the value $r_{nc}=1$ can be chosen for the $c$ which gives the minimum value of $\\lVert\\mathbf{x}_n-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c\\rVert^2$ .\n",
    "* The $n$th data point can then be assigned to the nearest cluster center:\n",
    "\t$$r_{nk} = \\left\\{\n",
    "\t\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "\t1 & \\,\\, \\mathrm{if} \\,\\, c = \\arg \\min_j \\lVert\\mathbf{x}_n-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_j\\rVert^2\\\\\n",

    "\t\\end{array}\\right.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "M-step: determine $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_k$\n",
    "* $J$ is a quadratic function of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$.\n",
    "* The derivate after $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ and equate to zero yields:\n",
    "\t$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\t\t\\sum_{n=1}^N r_{nc} (\\mathbf{x}_n-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c) & = & 0\\\\\n",
    "\t\t\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c & = & \\frac{\\sum_n r_{nc}\\mathbf{x}_n}{\\sum_n r_{nc}}\n",
    "\t\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "* The denominator is equal to the number of points assigned to the cluster. The value of $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_c$ is also equal to the mean of all points $\\mathbf{x}_n$ which belong to the cluster $c$. \n",
    "* This method is therefore also called *$C$-means algorithm* (some literature also calls it *$K$-means algorithm*).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* E-step and M-step are repeated until no change occurs in the assignment or that another break criterion (eg: maximum number of iterations) has been reached.\n",
    "* As the value of the target function $J$ is reduced in each step, convergence is guaranteed.\\pause\n",
    "* However convergence is also possible in a local minimum rather than in a global minimum.\n",

    "Assuming that each cluster center actually has data points assigned to it, setting the number of cluster centers $C$ equal to the number of data points $N$ would mean $J=0$. Each cluster center would have only one data point assigned and converge to exactly that point. The set of cluster centers would match the set of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the type of data, such a high number of cluster centers $C$ and the corresponding low number of data points per cluster might not always be useful.\n",

    "\n",
    "A heuristic for determining a suitable value for $C$ is the **Elbow method**.\n",
    "Starting at $C=1$ we compute the distortion $J_c$ for increasing $C$ in steps of one.\n",
    "To take the influence of $C$ on the computational complexity into account, we divide $J_c$ by $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\epsilon = \\frac{J_c}{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then plot $\\epsilon$ over $C$.\n",
    "If the resulting graph looks like a bent arm, we choose the value of $C$ that is at the \"elbow\" of the arm.\n",
