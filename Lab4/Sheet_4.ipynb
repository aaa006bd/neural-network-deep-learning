Moreover, the input and output values are normalized to the interval [0, 1]. Basic code to load the dataset and divide it into a training and test corpus, normalizing the data and to apply a multi-layer perceptron is provided below.\n",

    "Choose a suitable network topology (number of hidden layers and hidden neurons) and use it for the multi-layer perceptron defined below (see the lines marked with *# FIX!!!*). Try to avoid underfitting and overfitting. Furthermore, define a suitable multi-layer perceptron (again see the lines marked with *# FIX!!!*). Define and vary important parameters of the multi-layer perceptron in order to achieve a network performance as good as possible. Report on the found network configuration and on your conclusions.\n",

    "Remark: You may also use any deep learning framework to solve the exercise, e.g. the “Keras” python library with the “Tensorflow” python deep learning libaray, as suggested in http://gonzalopla.com/deep-learning-nonlinear-regression. This allows e.g. to apply stochastic dropout in order to reduce the risk of overfitting. It is however recommended to use a rather small number of hidden layers.\n",
